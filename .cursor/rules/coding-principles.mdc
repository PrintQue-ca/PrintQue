# Coding Principles

Follow DRY and SOLID principles in all code changes.

## DRY — Don't Repeat Yourself

- Extract repeated logic into shared functions or utilities.
- If you copy-paste code, stop and refactor it into a single reusable piece.
- Constants and config values belong in one place, not scattered across files.

## SOLID

- **Single Responsibility**: Each module, class, or function does one thing. If a function is growing large, split it.
- **Open/Closed**: Extend behavior through new code (new functions, subclasses, config) rather than modifying existing working code.
- **Liskov Substitution**: Subtypes must be usable wherever their parent type is expected without breaking behavior.
- **Interface Segregation**: Don't force callers to depend on methods they don't use. Keep interfaces small and focused.
- **Dependency Inversion**: Depend on abstractions, not concrete implementations. Pass dependencies in rather than hard-coding them.
