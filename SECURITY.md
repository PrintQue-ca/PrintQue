# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in PrintQue, **please do not open a public GitHub issue.**

Instead, report it privately through our Discord server so we can address it before it becomes public:

**Discord:** https://discord.gg/da4kuc3Axk

When reporting, please include:

- A description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- The potential impact

We will acknowledge your report within 48 hours and work with you on a fix.
